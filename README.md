# CryptoClustering
Module 19 Challenge

This challenge assignment required me to utliize an unsupervised learning model to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. Data was prepared using the StadardScaler function, and then the best value for 'k' was determined using the original scaled data. Clusters were then plotted using the results.

Clusters were then optimized using Principal Cluster Analysis (PCA). 'k' was plotted using the PCA data to determine the best number of clusters to use, and then clusters were plotted using this information.

Finally all charts were displayed side-by-side to determine best approach.
